1,000 Chip set
https://www.pokerchipforum.com/threads/1000-chip-set-breakdown.99018/

$1 x 200, $5x250, $25x200, $100x150, $500x100, $1000x100

"Most popular 2 table breakdown"
$25x 160, $100x 160, $500x 80, $1000x140, $5000x 60

If starting with a 1 denom chip (T1), a tournament set probably only needs T5, T25, T100 and T500 chips to run a tournament.
If the lowest denom is T25 chip, a set generally needs only T25 through T5000.
